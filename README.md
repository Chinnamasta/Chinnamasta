👋 Hi, I’m Joana — a psychologist in transition to tech, passionate about human-centered AI.

👀 I’m interested in AI applications, agents, ethical tech, and creative coding with purpose.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, LangChain, and how to build intelligent apps that solve real-life problems.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly open source projects and anything that blends empathy + technology.

📫 How to reach me: www.https://www.linkedin.com/in/joana-ottoni-7820b095/ or here on GitHub.

😄 Pronouns: she/her (ela/dela)
